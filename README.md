PyBer Analysis

Overview of the analysis

This challenge involved analyzing data for a ride-share company called PyBer.  The task was to write code using Pandas libraries, including Matplotlib to create visual displays that would show relationships between city types, drivers, riders, and fares.  The information gained through this exploratory data analysis will help PyBer determine where gaps in service delivery exist related to accessibility and affordability. 

Results

 
The ride-sharing summary dataframe (above) shows that the numbers of urban city rides and drivers are 13 and 21 times greater, respectively, to the rural city numbers.  While these numbers represent the widest disparity among city types, the numbers of urban city rides and drivers are also 2 Â½ and 5 times greater, respectively, to the suburban city numbers.   Although the total fares revenue is indicative of these number differences, the average fare by rider and driver numbers are inverted.  Rural city rides and drivers account for the highest revenues by average, followed by suburban cities, and last urban cities.  

A multiple-line chart (below) reflects total fares from January 1, 2019 to April 29, 2019 for each of the city types. This display is consistent with the summary data, but also shows revenues generated for a specific period.  The chart also illustrates how low revenues are in rural areas during these months.  Rural cities began and ended this period with revenue of $200/mo., but with a peak of $475/mo. in late February.  The suburban cities started this period with revenue of $750/mo. and ending with $1100/mo., with a peak of $1400 in late February.  The urban cities started with revenue of $1700/mo. and ended with $2100/mo., with a peak of $2500 in late February.  

 


Summary

Because rural cities account for the least number of rides and fares among all city types, but their average fare per ride is the highest, development of a marketing plan to increase ridership in this area is recommended.
Urban fare revenue in the January through April period peaks at multiple times, but decreases sharply at the end of April.  It is recommended that PyBer conduct an assessment to determine the possible reason for this and developing strategies for duplication and improvement.
It is recommended that Pyber find opportunities to engage the public to gather information about its service to the public related to accessibility and affordability.  Possible methods include surveys distributed to existing riders, community forums, and driver feedback.
